# skull-strip a single session

# This file is just here as a placeholder to point to the script to use for actual brain extraction:

# $bwDir/bwSkullStrip-singleSession.sh

# ...which gets called with a Hackney sessionDir as its single argument, e.g.,
# $bwDir/bwSkullStrip-singleSession.sh \
# /data/panolocal/processedOnPano-hackney/derivedData/omt001s01
