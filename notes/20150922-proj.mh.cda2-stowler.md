# Hackney CDA2 data notes, Tuesday 20150922, stowler

_Includes 4 h overtime: 6:30p-10:30p_

# Backup to hippoback

Launched: I rsync'd JN and MH's current data from pano to hipppoback:

```bash
[09:58:45]-[stowler-local]-at-[pano]-in-[/data/panolocal]
$ rsync -vr --progress processedOnPano-* stowler-local@hippoback.birc.emory.edu:/data/backup/Atlanta/stowlerWIP/sharedReadOnly/
#...snip...
```

# Launched FIX for taskFT: melodicFixWhII_Standard-gnuParallel10.ica

A batch of alternative FIX parameters for taskFT. Launched while the above rsync was still running, but had completed transfer of the processedOnPano-hackney directory.

```bash
TBD
```
