# Started notes directory

Started `notes` directory in github repo, in which I'll keep daily lab-notebook-style notes like this one. Though plenty of process metadata is captured by git commits, I need a way to record what operations are performed on which hosts, and to create a record of transfers between hosts.

# Migrated scripts from macs

Migrated more scripts from encrypted macs with out-of-date directory structure to pano/rama's up-to-date directory structure. Also added to github repo for portability, visibility, and revision tracking:

- `08.1.fix-singleRun.sh`
- `08.2.fix-taskFT-parallelRuns.sh`

# Tested migrated scripts

_Executed migrated scripts on pano/rama to create output that is consistent with current directory structures. Backed up results to hippoback._

## QC for fmri taskFT

Scripts were adapted to be compatible with current pano/rama directory structure, and also to run QC from non-sensitive nii files (FSL MNI orientation) instead of from DICOMs.

TBD: spot-checks to compare these QC results to QC results generated from original DICOMs.

```bash
# on pano, executed batch QC for fmri task CMG, gnu parallel jobs == 15:
[12:02:30]-[stowler-local]-at-[pano]-in-[~/src.mywork.gitRepos/proj.mh.cda2] on master
$ ./04.2.qc-taskFT-parallelSessions.sh 15
