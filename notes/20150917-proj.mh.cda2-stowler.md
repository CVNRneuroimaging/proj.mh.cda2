# ROIs: looking for October 2013 regions

In October 2013 Madeleine and I created niftis for most of her ROIs (email subject "image attached: proof of regions (minus SMA and CB)"). Screenshots indicate that this was done on OS X. Searching for those nifti files.

# backup to hippoback

With all of Joe's data now on pano, I rsync'd Joe and Madeleine's current data from pano to hippoback:

```bash
[14:22:06]-[stowler-local]-at-[pano]-in-[/data/panolocal]
$ rsync -vr --progress processedOnPano-* stowler-local@hippoback.birc.emory.edu:/data/backup/Atlanta/stowlerWIP/sharedReadOnly/

# task timing for GLM

## box.com

_I have limited access to MH's emory box.com because I'm accessing through personal account instead of through an emory sponsored account. I put in a request to give my existing emory sponsored account an emory box.com account: RITM41604._

Candidates for where MH may have current task timing on box.com:
- `./OMT/PDL/PDL regressors.zip` (updated today)
- `./OMT/PDF/PDF regressors.zip` (updated Aug 7)
- `./OMT/PDS/PDS regressors.zip` (updated Sept 1)
- `./OMT/OA/OMT OA regressors_IG_EG_voice` (updated Apr 10)

## earlier pilot analyses

Hippoback:

```bash
/data/backup/Atlanta/OMT/03.FmriRegressors
# ...a path which is supported by appearance in early October 2014 scripts like ap_OMT995_pilot0_block.sh:
#        stimTimesIG="/data/birc/Atlanta/OMT/03.FmriRegressors/OMT995/pilot0/IG_OMT995pilot0_stim_timing.1D"
#        stimTimesEG="/data/birc/Atlanta/OMT/03.FmriRegressors/OMT995/pilot0/EG_OMT995pilot0_stim_timing.1D"
#        stimTimesVoiceprompt="/data/birc/Atlanta/OMT/03.FmriRegressors/OMT995/pilot0/voicePrompt_OMT995pilot0_stim_file.1D"
```
